#### Notes
- ~~I'd like to add another chest in another room that can only be accessed once the player has the steel key.~~
- ~~Once the player finds the second chest they then get the Bronze key which unlocks the exit.~~
- Perhaps in the other chest a bat could attack the player, depleting health.
- I also want to find a way for this to be an exe file, so the game can be shared.
