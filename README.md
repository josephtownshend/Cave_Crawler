# Cave Crawler
 
### A simple GUI cave crawler based on the Makers Academy pre course challenge 'Cave Game' re-though using Java & Swing.

#### Notes
- I'd like to add some randomness to which chest contains the ring.
- Perhaps in the other chest a bat could attack the player, depleating health.
- I also want to find a way for this to be an exe file, so the game can be shared.
